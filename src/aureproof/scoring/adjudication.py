"""The adjudication queue, final decisions, agreement and post-adjudication counts.

Pure (issue #51; scoring.md §7; specs/adjudication). Every ``unresolved:*``
finding is queued; nothing is dropped. For each finding, the latest record per
adjudicator and role counts. A ``resolution`` record settles the finding.
Otherwise the independent adjudicators must agree, and if they don't, the
finding stays undecided. A ``label_change`` is decided but stays unresolved
under the current dataset revision: it needs a re-score under the new one. The
original matcher verdict is never changed.
