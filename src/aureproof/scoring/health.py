"""Scoring-time exclusion by task health (specs/thr §5).

Only health records frozen **before** the protocol freeze decide exclusion.
Episodes of an excluded task leave the cohort before metrics, so an unhealthy
task is reported as a dataset-health status and never as an agent false
positive. Records frozen afterwards are flagged as exploratory, not applied.
